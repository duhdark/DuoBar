## One glyph, three live states

DuoBar adapts the iPhone Duo-style three-in-one status concept for the Mac menu bar. One compact glyph presents the system information normally spread across several indicators:

- **Outer arc** → a live Battery Ring on MacBooks, or an Adaptive Ring on desktop Macs
- **Center** → the active network: Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or an offline/fallback state
- **Four lower dots** → live output volume

Persistent status stays monochrome and native-looking. When AirPods or another supported Bluetooth audio output becomes active, the center briefly transitions from Network → AirPods/headphones → Network. Disconnecting does not trigger an animation.

## Adaptive Ring and Battery Ring

On MacBooks, the outer Battery Ring shows live battery level, a dynamic charging bolt, and optional battery color coding for charging, Low Power Mode, and low-battery states. On desktop Macs, Adaptive Ring shows display brightness when publicly available and automatically surfaces sustained CPU, memory, or thermal pressure when it needs attention. It remains automatic: there is no manual metric selector.

## DuoBar on macOS

The original 1.0 release established DuoBar's Battery, Network, and Volume foundation. The current 1.2 release builds on it with broader connectivity controls, refined visuals, and localization.

## Requirements

**macOS 13.0+**<br>
**Apple Silicon or Intel**

## Installation

1. Download [DuoBar-1.2.0.dmg](https://github.com/Mikeli7666/DuoBar/releases/download/v1.2.0/DuoBar-1.2.0.dmg).
2. Open the DMG and move DuoBar to Applications.
3. Launch DuoBar.

DuoBar 1.2.0 uses Developer ID signing, Hardened Runtime, and Apple notarization. Never disable Gatekeeper or System Integrity Protection to install DuoBar.

## Permissions

- **Location:** macOS may require authorization before CoreWLAN can expose the current Wi-Fi network name. Denying access does not break basic connection, interface, or signal state; the SSID may simply remain unavailable. DuoBar requests SSID access only when it is useful to the interface.
- **Bluetooth:** DuoBar retains public Bluetooth controller observation while Core Audio provides the primary source for Bluetooth audio endpoints. The app does not manage or pair devices.

## Audio output behavior

Volume control is available only when the active Core Audio output exposes software-settable public volume properties. HDMI, AirPlay, USB, and other external outputs may instead display **Controlled by device**.

AirPods and Bluetooth audio classification is best-effort using public system metadata. DuoBar does not claim exact AirPods generation detection.

## Privacy

- System-status processing occurs locally.
- No analytics or tracking.
- No backend or telemetry.
- No system-status uploads.
- No unrelated network requests.

## Known limitations

- The Wi-Fi network name may be unavailable without Location permission or when macOS withholds it.
- Wi-Fi strength uses documented RSSI data and broad signal ranges; it does not reproduce Apple's private icon algorithm.
- Some audio devices expose fixed or externally controlled volume.
- DuoBar does not join Wi-Fi networks or pair Bluetooth devices.
- Bluetooth audio and AirPods family detection is best-effort through public APIs.

## Build from source

Open `DuoBar.xcodeproj` in Xcode, select the **DuoBar** scheme, and run. Debug builds include status simulation and marketing-capture tools; those tools are excluded from Release behavior.
